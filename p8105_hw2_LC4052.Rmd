# Problem 1

## Import data

```{r}
pols_month = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")

```

1. clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable

```{r}
separate()



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
