# Problem 1

```{r}
pols_month = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(mon, c("year", "month","day")) |>
  mutate(
    month = month.name[as.integer(month)],
    president = ifelse(prez_gop == 1, "gop", "dem")
  )|>
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
